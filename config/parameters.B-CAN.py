### HTTP servers ###
#~ What IP address and TCP port do you need to bind each server to?
#~ For how many seconds should unrefreshed data remain valid? 0.0 means that data never expire. After the delay, the server returns the HTTP status 504 Gateway Time-out.

### Serial port ###

#~ Should serial read operations use a local buffer? This can help save CPU power at high baud rates and thus avoid lost bytes.

#~ How many seconds to wait while scanning values from the sequence? Should be short (for config live-refresh) but reasonable (delay between frames). Should also be fast to quickly leave a buggy silent ATMA call. Adjustable with the API. Must be greater than 0.
